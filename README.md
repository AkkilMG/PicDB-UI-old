# PicDB

This is the UI interface for my new project to upload unlimited image file to Server to gain CDN (without losing the quality of the image). This service is free of cost. Do use it in limit. 
This project is to enhance my skills and showcase the new api created using fastapi to uphold the requests from scratch.
